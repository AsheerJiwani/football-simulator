## 🔑 Integration Points
1. **setPlayConcept()** → setupPlayers() → realignDefense() → UI
2. **setPersonnel()** → getOptimalDefensivePersonnel() → setupDefense() → UI
3. **sendInMotion()** → handleMotionAdjustments() → realignDefense() → UI
4. **updatePlayerPosition()** → analyzeFormation() → realignDefense() → UI
5. **setCoverage()** → setupDefense() → generateCoverageAlignment() → UI

## 📝 Implementation Notes
- Motion animation at realistic speeds (WR: 8.5-10.5 yd/s)
- Always exactly 7 defenders maintained
- Coverage transitions handle previousCoverage parameter
- Force realignment on coverage type changes
- Enhanced safety positioning for motion responses
