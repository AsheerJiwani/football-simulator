# User Autonomy Integration Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Implement seamless integration between offensive user controls and defensive AI responses, ensuring perfect backend coordination and complete user autonomy while maintaining NFL realism and 60fps performance.

## 📋 Core Requirements from Claude.md

### **Game Mechanics for USER AUTONOMY: IMPORTANT**

#### Coverage Selection Rules:
- ✅ Defensive coverage concept only changes when user selects a new coverage
- ✅ Defensive coverages render appropriately when user chooses it in top bar
- ✅ Offensive receiver routes, personnel, and alignment render when user chooses new play
- 🔄 **KEY**: Chosen coverage re-renders automatically when offense updates formation, personnel, or motions

#### Offensive Adjustments Rules:
- ✅ When user selects new play concept → offense updates to default routes, personnel, formation
- 🔄 **KEY**: Pre-selected defensive coverage re-renders dynamically based on new formation/personnel
- 🔄 **KEY**: When user changes motions, personnel, formation, or positions → defense adjusts within current coverage

#### Autonomy & Integration Rules:
- 🔄 **KEY**: User has full autonomy to adjust offensive plays, motions, personnel, formations, positions
- 🔄 **KEY**: Defense always renders dynamically in response to offensive changes
- ✅ Coverage logic, route mechanics, motions, alignments reflect real NFL rules
- ✅ Snap logic, throws, openness, outcomes never break during pre-snap adjustments
- ✅ All changes must be seamless and integrated

## 🚧 Implementation Notes

### NFL Realism Requirements:
- All coverage adjustments must use research subagent for factual mechanics
- Formation strength recognition (trips, bunch, stack concepts)
- Motion rules (inside/outside leverage, pick plays, overload concepts)
- Personnel package matchups (nickel vs 3WR, dime vs 4WR, etc.)

### Motion Animation Constraint (Added 2025-01-14):
- **Player motion MUST render at realistic NFL speeds based on player type**
  - WR: 8.5-10.5 yards/second (avg 8.91 yd/s from research)
  - RB: 8.5-10.0 yards/second (avg 8.87 yd/s from research)
  - TE: 7.5-9.0 yards/second (avg 8.46 yd/s from research)
  - FB: 7.5-8.5 yards/second (conservative estimate)
- **Motion duration calculation**: `duration = distance / player_speed`
- **UI rendering requirements**:
  - Smooth interpolation at 60fps with velocity vector updates
  - Visual motion path indicator showing direction
  - Real-time position updates synced with game state
  - No position jumps or jerky movements
- **Test environment handling**:
  - Motion completes instantly but with correct final position
  - All defensive adjustments trigger immediately
  - Motion boost flags set properly for post-snap

### Performance Considerations:
- Minimize recalculations during realignDefense()
- Optimize formation analysis algorithms
- Cache expensive coverage calculations where possible
- Use RAF for smooth animations during transitions

### State Management Architecture:
- Ensure proper event ordering in Zustand store
- Prevent cascade loops between offense/defense updates
- Maintain atomic updates for complex multi-parameter changes
- Use selective re-rendering to avoid unnecessary updates
