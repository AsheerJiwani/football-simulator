  - Removed debug logging after verification

## 📋 Next Steps

### Phase 5: Add Plays, Add Coverages, Testing & Validation (Remaining)

**Step 5.3.2: Fix Fundamental Issues (COMPLETED)**
- [x] Fixed zone depth type errors in Engine.ts
- [x] Audited and fixed all defender positioning calculations
- [x] Added debug logging to trace state updates
- [x] Verified defenders are positioned correctly relative to LOS
- [x] Ensured UI components receive state updates properly

**Step 5.3.3: Fix Coverage/Play Selection Rendering Issues (ONGOING)**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Shallow Copy Issue in getGameState()**
   - The `getGameState()` method returns `{ ...this.gameState }` which is a shallow copy
   - The `players` array reference might be the same, causing React not to detect changes
   - Even though we fixed immutable updates in setupPlayers/setupDefense, the shallow copy might negate this

2. **Store Selector Issue**
   - `usePlayers()` selector directly returns `state.gameState.players`
   - If the players array reference doesn't change, React won't re-render
   - The stateVersion we added should help, but the selector isn't using it

3. **Initial State vs Update State**
   - Initial setup in createInitialEngine() works (shows players on load)
   - Updates through setConcept/setCoverage might not be propagating correctly

**Implementation Completed:** 
- [x] Fixed getGameState() to return deep copy with new players array reference
- [x] Added temporary debug logging to verify state changes
- [x] Updated store update logic for better immutability
- [x] Enhanced selector with lastUpdate tracking
- [x] Fixed component key generation to use stable keys
- [x] Tested coverage changes render new defensive alignments
- [x] Tested play changes render new offensive formations
- [x] Cleaned up debug logging after verification
