# User Autonomy Integration Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Implement seamless integration between offensive user controls and defensive AI responses, ensuring perfect backend coordination and complete user autonomy while maintaining NFL realism and 60fps performance.

## 📋 Core Requirements from Claude.md

### **Game Mechanics for USER AUTONOMY: IMPORTANT**

#### Coverage Selection Rules:
- ✅ Defensive coverage concept only changes when user selects a new coverage
- ✅ Defensive coverages render appropriately when user chooses it in top bar
- ✅ Offensive receiver routes, personnel, and alignment render when user chooses new play
- 🔄 **KEY**: Chosen coverage re-renders automatically when offense updates formation, personnel, or motions

#### Offensive Adjustments Rules:
- ✅ When user selects new play concept → offense updates to default routes, personnel, formation
- 🔄 **KEY**: Pre-selected defensive coverage re-renders dynamically based on new formation/personnel
- 🔄 **KEY**: When user changes motions, personnel, formation, or positions → defense adjusts within current coverage

#### Autonomy & Integration Rules:
- 🔄 **KEY**: User has full autonomy to adjust offensive plays, motions, personnel, formations, positions
- 🔄 **KEY**: Defense always renders dynamically in response to offensive changes
- ✅ Coverage logic, route mechanics, motions, alignments reflect real NFL rules
- ✅ Snap logic, throws, openness, outcomes never break during pre-snap adjustments
- ✅ All changes must be seamless and integrated
