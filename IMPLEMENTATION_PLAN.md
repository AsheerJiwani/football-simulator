    /coverages.json
  /lib
    /math.ts          # Vector calculations
  /store
    /gameStore.ts     # Zustand store
```

## Phase 2: Core Engine Development âœ…

### 2.1 Type System & Data Models
- [x] Define Player interface (position, speed, route, coverage responsibility)
- [x] Define Ball interface (position, velocity, state)
- [x] Define GameConfig (field dimensions, tick rate, physics constants)
- [x] Define Route types (Slant, Flat, Go, Curl, etc.)
- [x] Define Coverage types (Cover 1, Cover 2, etc.)

### 2.2 Engine Implementation
- [x] Implement 60Hz game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Create snap() method to initiate play
- [x] Implement throwTo(receiverId) method
- [x] Build tick(deltaTime) update logic
- [x] Calculate player movements based on routes/coverage
- [x] Implement ball physics (constant speed trajectory)
- [x] Build collision detection (catch radius, tackle radius)
- [x] Calculate openness percentage algorithm

### 2.3 Initial Play Content
- [x] Implement Slant-Flat concept
- [x] Create Trips Right formation
- [x] Build Cover 1 defensive logic
- [x] Test catch/incompletion outcomes

### 2.4 Research Validation & NFL Realism âœ…
- [x] Research and validate player speeds using NFL combine data
- [x] Update ball physics to realistic 25 yd/s velocity (~55mph)
- [x] Validate Cover 1 defensive positioning and leverage
- [x] Refine Slant-Flat route timing based on coaching analysis
- [x] Implement data-driven JSON configuration system

## Phase 3: UI & State Management

### 3.1 Zustand Store Setup âœ…
- [x] Create gameStore with engine instance
- [x] Implement selectors for UI subscriptions
- [x] Add actions (snap, throw, reset, updateConfig)
- [x] Optimize for 60Hz updates with selective renders

### 3.2 Field Canvas Component âœ…
- [x] SVG-based field rendering (120 yards Ã— 53.33 yards)
- [x] Player dots with team colors (blue offense, red defense)
- [x] Ball trajectory visualization with state indicators
- [x] Real-time position updates from engine via Zustand
- [x] Yard lines and hash marks with proper NFL scaling
- [x] Route path visualization and coverage zone indicators
- [x] Star player and motion boost visual indicators

### 3.3 Controls Panel âœ…
- [x] Formation selector dropdown (loads from JSON data)
- [x] Coverage selector dropdown (Cover 1, Cover 2, Cover 3)
- [x] Snap button (triggers engine.snap())
- [x] Dynamic throw buttons for eligible receivers
- [x] Sack timer slider (2-10 seconds, locked in Challenge Mode)
- [x] Reset play button and game mode toggle
- [x] Play outcome display with detailed results
- [x] Help section with usage instructions

### 3.4 Integration âœ…
- [x] Connect UI to Zustand store with optimized selectors
- [x] Real-time game loop polling at 30fps during play
- [x] Handle all user interactions (snap, throw, reset, config)
- [x] Display detailed play outcomes (yards, openness %, catch probability)

## Deployment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Basic Deployment (End of Phase 1)
- [x] Next.js app runs locally
- [x] GitHub repo created and connected
- [x] Vercel deployment successful
- [x] Basic landing page visible

### Checkpoint 2: Engine MVP (End of Phase 2) âœ…
- [x] Engine runs with 60Hz game loop and realistic physics
- [x] Slant-Flat vs Cover 1 executes successfully with proper timing
- [x] Physics calculations validated with NFL research data
- [x] Deployed to Vercel with working engine and JSON data

### Checkpoint 3: Playable Prototype (End of Phase 3) âœ…
- [x] UI controls trigger all engine actions (snap, throw, reset)
- [x] Field shows real-time player movement with 30fps updates
- [x] Can complete full play cycle with detailed outcomes
- [x] Deployed and fully playable on Vercel at localhost:3004
