#### A. Formation Recognition System ✅
```javascript
FormationAnalyzer {
  - detectStrength(): 'left' | 'right' | 'balanced' ✅
  - identifyReceiverSets(): trips, bunch, stack, spread ✅
  - calculateLeverages(): inside/outside for each defender ✅
  - determineGaps(): A, B, C, D gap responsibilities ✅
}
```

#### B. Personnel Matching Logic ✅
```javascript
PersonnelMatcher {
  - vs 10 personnel (4WR): Deploy Dime (6 DBs, 1 LB) ✅
  - vs 11 personnel (3WR): Deploy Nickel (5 DBs, 2 LBs) ✅
  - vs 12 personnel (2TE): Deploy Base (4 DBs, 3 LBs) ✅
  - vs 21 personnel (2RB): Deploy Heavy (3 DBs, 4 LBs) ✅
  - Special rules for goal line and prevent ✅
}

// Coverage-Personnel Compatibility Rules
CoverageCompatibility {
  tampa2: {
    required: { minLBs: 3 },  // Mike LB must drop deep
    incompatible: ['Dime'],   // Only 1 LB in Dime
    alternative: 'Cover 2'    // Suggest regular Cover 2 instead
  },
  // ... full compatibility matrix implemented
}
```

#### C. Coverage-Specific Adjustment Rules ✅
```javascript
CoverageAdjustments {
  cover0: { greenDogRules, hotRouteRecognition, pressureAngles },
  cover1: { robberPositioning, bracketCoverage, ratAssignment },
  cover2: { cloudSkyRotation, palmsTechnique, trapCoverage },
  cover3: { buzzRotation, seamCurlRules, fireZone },
  cover4: { patternMatchTriggers, stubbieRules, poachTechnique },
  cover6: { fieldBoundaryDetermination, quartersToField },
  tampa2: { mikeLBProgression, wallTechnique, deepHole }
}
```

#### D. Motion Response System ✅
```javascript
MotionAdjustments {
  - Rock & Roll: Safety exchange based on motion direction ✅
  - Buzz: Rotation with motion (Cover 3) ✅
  - Lock: Man defender follows motion ✅
  - Zone: Bump zones toward motion ✅
  - Spin: Full rotation opposite of motion ✅
}
```

#### E. Post-Snap Execution Rules ✅
```javascript
PostSnapRules {
  - Route distribution rules (ROBOT - Rhythm, Over, Between, Outside, Through) ✅
  - Leverage maintenance (inside/outside based on help) ✅
  - Zone handoff triggers (carry vs collision) ✅
  - Pattern match conversions ✅
  - Pursuit angle calculations ✅
}
```
