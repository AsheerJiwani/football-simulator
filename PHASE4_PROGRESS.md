  - [x] Implement boundary side cover 2
  - [x] Test split-field adjustments

### 3. Motion Mechanics ✅
- [x] **Engine Implementation**
  - [x] Add motion state to GameState
  - [x] Implement pre-snap motion paths
  - [x] Apply 12% speed boost for 0.35s at snap
  - [x] Update defensive alignment reactions

- [x] **UI Controls**
  - [x] Add motion button to ControlsPanel
  - [x] Show motion preview on field
  - [x] Animate motion smoothly
  - [x] Disable during play phase

### 4. Audibles System ✅
- [x] **Engine Implementation**
  - [x] Track audibles used count
  - [x] Allow route changes pre-snap
  - [x] Enforce max 2 audibles in Challenge Mode
  - [x] Update route assignments dynamically

- [x] **UI Controls**
  - [x] Add audible picker component
  - [x] Show available routes per receiver
  - [x] Display audibles remaining counter
  - [x] Disable when limit reached

### 5. Pass Protection ✅
- [x] **Logic Implementation**
  - [x] Identify eligible blockers (RB/TE/FB)
  - [x] Check alignment for blocking eligibility
  - [x] Remove blockers from route runners
  - [x] Animate blocking assignments

- [x] **UI Controls**
  - [x] Add pass protection toggles
  - [x] Show blocking assignments visually with "Show Routes" button
  - [x] Update formation display

### 6. Blitzer Sack Time Reduction ✅
- [x] **Detection Logic**
  - [x] Identify blitzing defenders from coverage
  - [x] Count total blitzers

- [x] **Time Calculation**
  - [x] Implement proportional reduction formula
  - [x] 1 blitzer: 0.3-2.0s reduction (scaled)
  - [x] 2+ blitzers: 0.7-4.0s reduction (scaled)
  - [x] Add randomization within ranges

- [x] **Testing**
  - [x] Verify Cover 0 reduces time appropriately
  - [x] Test scaling with different base sack times
  - [x] Ensure randomization works correctly

### 7. Integration & Testing ✅
- [x] **Alignment System**
  - [x] Update alignment.ts for new coverages
  - [x] Add coverage-specific alignment functions
  - [x] Test all formation/coverage combinations

- [x] **Performance Testing**
  - [x] Verify 60Hz tick rate maintained
  - [x] Profile engine with all features enabled
  - [x] Optimize any bottlenecks

- [x] **Visual Testing**
  - [x] Verify all routes render correctly
  - [x] Check coverage alignments are accurate
  - [x] Test motion animations
  - [x] Validate UI responsiveness

## Implementation Order
1. ✅ Create this tracking document
2. ✅ Add new route concepts to concepts.json
3. ✅ Add new coverages to coverages.json
4. ✅ Update alignment.ts for new coverages
5. ✅ Implement motion mechanics
6. ✅ Implement audibles system
7. ✅ Implement pass protection logic
8. ✅ Implement blitzer sack time reduction
9. ✅ Integration testing
10. ✅ Performance optimization

## Notes
- All NFL mechanics have been researched and validated
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing plays/coverages
- Keep engine pure TypeScript without React dependencies
- Update Zustand store carefully to avoid re-render issues

## Legend
