# Defensive Coverage Improvement Plan

## üìã Mission Statement
Transform our defensive coverage system from basic zone/man assignments to NFL-realistic pattern matching, zone coordination, and situational awareness based on comprehensive research of modern NFL defensive mechanics.

## üîç Research Summary

### Current System Strengths
‚úÖ **Research-backed constants** for alignment depths and leverages
‚úÖ **Dynamic personnel matching** (Base/Nickel/Dime) based on offensive sets
‚úÖ **Formation-aware positioning** for trips, strength, and basic adjustments
‚úÖ **Multiple coverage implementations** (Cover 0-6) with unique alignment logic
‚úÖ **Immutable state management** ensuring smooth UI updates

### Critical Gaps Identified
‚ùå **No Pattern Matching**: Cover 3 lacks modern "RIP/LIZ" pattern matching rules
‚ùå **Incorrect Cover 2**: CBs use bail technique instead of NFL press/jam technique
‚ùå **Missing Zone Coordination**: No "deeper than deepest" communication between zones
‚ùå **Static Leverage Rules**: Leverage based on formation, not route recognition
‚ùå **No Motion Response**: Missing Rock & Roll safety exchanges and bump adjustments
‚ùå **No Situational Logic**: No down/distance or field position adjustments

## üéØ Implementation Phases

---

## **Phase 1: Core Coverage Fixes (High Impact)**

### **Task 1.1: Fix Cover 2 Cornerback Technique** ‚úÖ
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

**Problem**: CBs currently use "bail" technique (7-yard depth) instead of proper Cover 2 press/jam technique
**NFL Reality**: Cover 2 CBs must press #1 receivers at LOS, jam inside, then sink to flat zones

**Implementation Steps**:
- [x] Update `COVER_2_CONSTANTS` with proper press technique parameters
- [x] Modify `getCover2Cornerback()` to use press alignment (1-2 yard depth)
- [x] Add inside leverage logic for jamming slants/hitches
- [x] Update coverage responsibility from "man" to "press-to-flat-zone"
- [x] Test vs quick game concepts (slant-flat, hitch-seam)

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/engine/alignment.ts` - Update constants and CB positioning logic
- `src/engine/types.ts` - Add press technique types if needed

**Testing Criteria**:
- CBs align at 1-2 yards vs #1 receivers
- Inside leverage vs slot formations
- Proper sink to flat zone on deep routes

---

### **Task 1.2: Implement Cover 3 Pattern Matching** ‚úÖ
**Status**: COMPLETED (with notes)
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

**Problem**: Cover 3 uses pure zone coverage instead of modern pattern matching
**NFL Reality**: Cover 3 switches to man coverage when receivers run vertical routes (RIP/LIZ match)

**Implementation Steps**:
- [x] Research and document RIP/LIZ pattern matching rules
- [x] Add route recognition logic for vertical vs horizontal routes
- [x] Implement pattern match triggers (12+ yard vertical routes)
- [x] Add "man-match" coverage type to defender responsibilities
- [x] Update `generateCover3Alignment()` with pattern matching logic
- [x] Add communication between deep third defenders
- [x] Test vs vertical concepts (4 verts, smash, dagger)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Pattern matching logic implemented for post-snap movement
- Pre-snap alignment maintains zone coverage for consistent test behavior
- Route classification system added with vertical/horizontal thresholds
- Deep third defenders can switch to man-match on vertical routes 12+ yards

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/engine/alignment.ts` - Add pattern matching functions
- `src/engine/types.ts` - Add pattern match coverage types
- `src/engine/movement.ts` - Add route recognition during play

**Testing Criteria**:
- Defenders switch to man on vertical routes at 12+ yards
- Zone coverage maintained on horizontal routes
- Proper pattern match vs 4 verts, smash concepts

---

### **Task 1.3: Add Zone Coordination Rules** üîÑ
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

**Problem**: Zones operate independently without NFL communication rules
**NFL Reality**: Zones coordinate with "deeper than deepest" and overlap responsibilities

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Add zone communication constants and rules
- [ ] Implement "deeper than deepest" logic for deep zones
- [ ] Add zone overlap detection and adjustment
- [ ] Create landmark-based positioning (top of route stems)
- [ ] Add zone expansion/contraction based on receiver distribution
- [ ] Test zone coordination vs bunch and spread formations

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/engine/alignment.ts` - Add zone coordination functions
- `src/engine/movement.ts` - Add post-snap zone adjustments

**Testing Criteria**:
- Deep zones maintain proper depth relative to receivers
- Zones expand/contract based on receiver threats
- No coverage gaps between adjacent zones

---

### **Task 1.4: Implement Motion Response System** üîÑ
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

**Problem**: Defense doesn't adjust realistically to offensive motion
**NFL Reality**: Motion triggers specific responses (Rock & Roll, Bump, Lock)

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Research motion response rules for each coverage type
- [ ] Add motion detection and classification logic
- [ ] Implement Rock & Roll (safety exchange) for Cover 2/4
- [ ] Add Bump adjustments for Cover 3 (lateral defender shifts)
- [ ] Implement Lock coverage for Cover 1 (man follows motion)
- [ ] Add motion communication between defenders
- [ ] Test with cross-formation and orbit motion

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/engine/Engine.ts` - Add motion response integration
- `src/engine/alignment.ts` - Add motion adjustment functions
- `src/engine/movement.ts` - Add motion tracking during play

**Testing Criteria**:
- Proper safety exchange on cross-formation motion in Cover 2
- Lateral bump adjustments in Cover 3
- Man coverage follows motion in Cover 1
