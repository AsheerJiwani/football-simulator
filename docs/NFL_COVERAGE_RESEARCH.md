## Coverage Systems

### Cover 0 - All-Out Blitz

#### Core Philosophy
- **Pure man coverage** with zero deep safety help
- **Maximum pressure** scheme with 5-6 rushers
- **Inside leverage** preferred to force routes to boundary
- **Green dog rules** for LB-to-RB assignments

#### Pre-Snap Alignment (TypeScript Ready)
```typescript
const cover0Alignment = {
  CB1: { x: 10, y: 1.5, depth: 1.5, leverage: "inside", technique: "press" },
  CB2: { x: 43, y: 1.5, depth: 1.5, leverage: "inside", technique: "press" },
  NCB: { x: 25, y: 4, depth: 4, leverage: "head-up", assignment: "slot" },
  SS: { x: 30, y: 10, depth: 10, leverage: "varies", assignment: "#2_or_TE" },
  FS: { x: 23, y: 10, depth: 10, leverage: "varies", assignment: "#3_or_RB" },
  MLB: { x: 26.67, y: 5, depth: 5, leverage: "head-up", assignment: "RB_or_blitz" },
  OLB: { x: 35, y: 6, depth: 6, leverage: "outside", assignment: "TE_or_blitz" }
};
```

#### Blitz Mechanics
- **Standard 6-Man Pressure**: MLB A-gap, OLB B-gap blitz
- **Green Dog Rules**: LB converts to rush if RB stays in protection
- **SackTime Impact**:
  - 1 blitzer: -0.3 to -2.0s reduction
  - 2 blitzers: -0.7 to -4.0s reduction

#### Formation Adjustments
| Formation | Adjustment | Implementation |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| vs Trips | Bump NCB to trips #3 | Safety rotates to help |
| vs Bunch | Box technique | Tight man coverage, fight through picks |
| vs Empty | 5 man coverage | No help underneath |
| vs 12 Personnel | SS on TE | OLB may blitz |

#### Motion Response
- **Rock & Roll**: Safety exchange on cross-field motion
- **Lock Technique**: Assigned defender follows motion player
- **Bump Adjustment**: All defenders shift toward motion

### Cover 1 - Man-Free Safety

#### Core Philosophy
- **Man coverage with single-high safety** providing deep help
- **Robber/Hole player** (SS or LB) provides underneath support
- **Outside leverage** on corners with safety help over top
- **Rat/Spy** option for QB contain

#### Pre-Snap Alignment (TypeScript Ready)
```typescript
const cover1Alignment = {
  FS: { x: 26.67, y: 13.5, depth: 13.5, position: "center_field", shade: "strength" },
  SS: { x: 30, y: 10, depth: 10, position: "robber_hole", leverage: "inside_#2" },
  CB1: { x: 10, y: 7.5, depth: 7.5, leverage: "outside", technique: "off-man" },
  CB2: { x: 43, y: 7.5, depth: 7.5, leverage: "outside", technique: "off-man" },
  NCB: { x: 25, y: 5.5, depth: 5.5, leverage: "inside", assignment: "slot" },
  MLB: { x: 26.67, y: 4.5, depth: 4.5, assignment: "man_or_spy" },
  OLB: { x: 35, y: 5, depth: 5, assignment: "man_on_RB_TE" }
};
```

#### Coverage Variations
| Variation | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Robber | SS drops to hole at 8-12 yards | vs Crossing routes |
| Rat/Spy | MLB mirrors QB at 6-8 yards | vs Mobile QBs |
| Bracket | Double team on #1 receiver | vs Elite WRs |
| Jump Call | FS comes down, CB rotates deep | vs Bunch formations |

#### Motion Adjustments
- **Lock**: Man defender follows motion player across formation
- **Defense Travels**: All defenders shift 2-3 yards toward motion
- **Robber Adjustment**: Hole defender bumps toward motion side

### Cover 2 - Two Deep Safeties

#### Core Philosophy
- **Two deep safeties** split field into halves
- **Five underneath** defenders in zone coverage
- **Hard corner technique** with jam and sink
- **Vulnerable in deep middle** (Tampa 2 addresses this)

#### Pre-Snap Alignment (TypeScript Ready)
```typescript
const cover2Alignment = {
  CB1: { x: 10, y: 6, depth: 6, leverage: "outside", technique: "hard_press" },
  CB2: { x: 43, y: 6, depth: 6, leverage: "outside", technique: "hard_press" },
  FS: { x: 17, y: 15, depth: 15, position: "deep_half", split: "numbers" },
  SS: { x: 36, y: 15, depth: 15, position: "deep_half", split: "numbers" },
  MLB: { x: 26.67, y: 4.5, depth: 4.5, zone: "hook", landmark: "center" },
  WLB: { x: 18, y: 4.5, depth: 4.5, zone: "seam_hook", landmark: "numbers" },
  SLB: { x: 35, y: 4.5, depth: 4.5, zone: "seam_hook", landmark: "numbers" }
};
```

#### Zone Responsibilities
| Zone | Depth Range | Width | Defenders | Landmarks |
|------|-------------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Deep Half | 18-25+ yards | Hash to sideline | FS, SS | Top of numbers |
| Flat | 0-7 yards | Numbers to sideline | CB | Behind LOS to 7 yards |
| Hook | 8-12 yards | Guard to guard | MLB | Middle of field |
| Seam-Hook | 10-12 yards | Hash to numbers | OLB | Outside hash marks |

#### Cover 2 Variations
- **Palms Technique**: Pattern match vs 2×2 formations
- **Cloud Coverage**: Corner maintains flat, safety stays deep
- **Sky Coverage**: Safety rotates to flat, corner bails deep

### Cover 3 - Three Deep Zones

#### Core Philosophy
- **Three deep zones** with four underneath defenders
- **Pattern matching** triggers on vertical routes
- **Multiple rotation options** (Sky, Buzz, Cloud)
- **Strong run support** with 8 in the box

#### Pre-Snap Alignment (TypeScript Ready)
```typescript
const cover3Alignment = {
  CB1: { x: 10, y: 6.5, depth: 6.5, leverage: "outside", technique: "bail" },
  CB2: { x: 43, y: 6.5, depth: 6.5, leverage: "outside", technique: "bail" },
  FS: { x: 26.67, y: 13.5, depth: 13.5, position: "deep_middle", width: "hash_to_hash" },
  SS: { x: 30, y: 13.5, depth: 13.5, position: "varies_by_rotation" },
  MLB: { x: 26.67, y: 4.5, depth: 4.5, zone: "hook", landmark: "outside_hash" },
  WLB: { x: 18, y: 5, depth: 5, zone: "curl_flat", landmark: "numbers" },
  SLB: { x: 35, y: 5, depth: 5, zone: "curl_flat", landmark: "numbers" }
};
```

#### Rotation Types
| Rotation | Description | Coverage Distribution |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Sky | SS rolls to deep third | CB-FS-SS deep, 4 under |
| Buzz | SS drops to hook/curl | CB-FS-CB deep, SS under |
| Cloud | Corners press-bail | CB-FS-CB deep, SS flat |

#### Pattern Match Triggers
- **#2 Vertical (>10 yards)**: Curl/flat defender carries in man coverage
- **Seam Rule**: Never let receiver run seam unattended
- **Under Call**: If #2 runs <5 yards, stay in zone coverage
- **Deep Route Priority**: Corners bail to deep third, pass off underneath

### Cover 4 - Quarters Pattern Match

#### Core Philosophy
- **Four deep defenders** with pattern match rules
- **2-Read progression** for safeties (#2 to #1)
- **Man principles within zone** framework
- **Adaptable to route distributions**

#### Pre-Snap Alignment (TypeScript Ready)
```typescript
const cover4Alignment = {
  CB1: { x: 10, y: 8, depth: 8, leverage: "outside_#1", technique: "MOD" },
  CB2: { x: 43, y: 8, depth: 8, leverage: "outside_#1", technique: "MOD" },
  FS: { x: 20, y: 12, depth: 12, leverage: "inside_#2", read: "2_to_1" },
  SS: { x: 34, y: 12, depth: 12, leverage: "inside_#2", read: "2_to_1" },
  MLB: { x: 26.67, y: 6, depth: 6, zone: "hook", read: "#2_#3" },
  WLB: { x: 8, y: 5, depth: 5, zone: "flat_wheel" },
  SLB: { x: 45, y: 5, depth: 5, zone: "flat_wheel" }
};
```

#### Pattern Match Rules
| Rule | Trigger | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| MEG (Man Everywhere) | #1 receiver assignment | Lock on #1 anywhere on field |
| MOD (Man on Demand) | #1 goes >5-7 yards | Corner attaches in man |
| #2 Vertical | #2 goes >12 yards | Safety converts to man |
| Solo | Backside in 3×1 | Safety poaches #3 vertical |
| Stubbie | Trips formation | Special rules for collision |

#### Formation-Specific Coverage
- **vs 2×2**: Standard quarters alignment, balanced coverage
- **vs 3×1 Trips**: Stubbie to trips side, Solo backside
- **vs Bunch**: Box technique with 4-over-3 coverage
- **vs Empty**: Mike becomes "Rat" in middle hole

### Cover 6 - Split-Field Coverage

#### Core Philosophy
- **Hybrid coverage**: Cover 4 to field/strong, Cover 2 to boundary/weak
- **Adaptable to formation** strength and field position
- **Pattern match on Cover 4 side**, zone on Cover 2 side
- **Excellent vs 3×1 formations**

#### Pre-Snap Alignment (TypeScript Ready)
```typescript
// Cover 4 Side (Field/Strong)
const cover6QuartersSide = {
  CB: { x: 10, y: 7.5, depth: 7.5, leverage: "inside", technique: "press_bail" },
  Safety: { x: 20, y: 13, depth: 13, position: "quarter", read: "pattern_match" },
  LB: { x: 18, y: 5, depth: 5, zone: "flat", leverage: "apex" }
};

// Cover 2 Side (Boundary/Weak)
const cover6Cover2Side = {
  CB: { x: 43, y: 6, depth: 6, leverage: "outside", technique: "press_funnel" },
  Safety: { x: 36, y: 13.5, depth: 13.5, position: "deep_half" },
  LB: { x: 35, y: 5, depth: 5, zone: "seam", sink: "10-12_yards" }
};

// Middle
const cover6Middle = {
  MLB: { x: 26.67, y: 4.5, depth: 4.5, zone: "middle_hook", wall: "crossers" }
};
```

#### Coverage Distribution
| Side | Coverage Type | Defenders | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Field/Strong | Cover 4 | CB, S, LB | Pattern match quarters |
| Boundary/Weak | Cover 2 | CB, S, LB | Half-field zone |
| Middle | Hook | MLB | Wall crossing routes |

#### Motion Adjustments
- **Traditional**: Maintain original side assignments
- **Targeted**: Rotate coverage based on new strength
- **Check Call**: Allows coverage flip based on motion

### Tampa 2 - Deep Mike Linebacker

#### Core Philosophy
- **Modified Cover 2** with MLB dropping to deep middle
- **Three deep zones** effectively (2 safeties + MLB)
- **Requires athletic MLB** capable of 15-20 yard drops
- **Minimum 3 LBs required** (incompatible with Dime package)

#### Pre-Snap Alignment (TypeScript Ready)
```typescript
const tampa2Alignment = {
  CB1: { x: 10, y: 4.5, depth: 4.5, leverage: "outside", technique: "hard_jam" },
  CB2: { x: 43, y: 4.5, depth: 4.5, leverage: "outside", technique: "hard_jam" },
  FS: { x: 17, y: 13, depth: 13, position: "deep_half", split: "numbers" },
  SS: { x: 36, y: 13, depth: 13, position: "deep_half", split: "numbers" },
  MLB: { x: 26.67, y: 4.5, depth: 4.5, progression: "8→12→18_yards" },
  WLB: { x: 18, y: 3.5, depth: 3.5, zone: "wall", depth_drop: "7-10_yards" },
  SLB: { x: 35, y: 3.5, depth: 3.5, zone: "wall", depth_drop: "7-10_yards" }
};
```

#### Mike LB Progression Timeline
| Time | Action | Depth | Read |
|------|--------|-------|------|
| 0-0.5s | Step toward LOS | 4-5 yards | Diagnose run/pass |
| 0.5-1.0s | Begin drop | 8 yards | Eyes on QB |
| 1.0-2.0s | Continue drop | 12 yards | Scan for verticals |
| 2.0s+ | Settle | 15-18 yards | Carry any seam |

#### Personnel Compatibility
- **Base (4-3)**: ✅ Optimal - 3 LBs available
- **Nickel (4-2-5)**: ⚠️ Possible - 2 LBs, safety may substitute
- **Dime (4-1-6)**: ❌ Incompatible - Only 1 LB
- **Suggested Alternative**: Regular Cover 2 when in Dime

## Implementation Parameters

### Depth Guidelines by Coverage
| Coverage | CB Depth | Safety Depth | LB Depth | Key Notes |
|----------|----------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Cover 0 | 1-2 yards (press) | 8-10 yards | 4-6 yards | No deep help |
| Cover 1 | 7-8 yards (off) | 12-15 yards (FS) | 4-5 yards | Single high |

### Speed Modifiers
```typescript
const COVERAGE_SPEED_MODIFIERS = {
  backpedal: 0.85,      // Defensive backs moving backward
  pattern_match: 0.95,  // Reading routes while moving
  zone_drop: 0.90,      // Dropping to zone landmark
  man_coverage: 1.0,    // Full speed when locked on receiver
  press_jam: 0.7,       // Reduced speed during jam
  bail_technique: 0.88  // Corners bailing to deep third
};
```

### Zone Dimensions
| Zone Type | Width | Depth | Height | Typical Defenders |
|-----------|-------|-------|--------|------------------|
| Deep Third | 17.77 yards | 20-30 yards | 25 yards | CB, FS |
| Deep Half | 26.67 yards | 18-25 yards | 25 yards | FS, SS |
| Deep Quarter | 13.33 yards | 15-25 yards | 20 yards | CB, S |

| Flat | 15-20 yards | 0-7 yards | 7 yards | CB, LB |
| Seam | 8-10 yards | 10-15 yards | 10 yards | LB, S |

## Motion Adjustment Protocols

### Pre-Snap Motion Response Matrix
| Motion Type | Cover 0 | Cover 1 | Cover 2 | Cover 3 | Cover 4 | Cover 6 | Tampa 2 |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Fly (across) | Lock | Lock + Travel | Minimal | Buzz/Sky | Pattern adjust | Check call | Minimal |
| Orbit (backfield) | Lock | Robber adjust | Zone bump | Spin | Lock | Maintain | Zone bump |
| Jet (speed) | Lock | Lock | Flat widens | Buzz down | MEG trigger | Quarters adjust | Flat widens |
| Return | Lock | Lock | Minimal | Reset | Reset | Reset | Minimal |
| Shift | Re-align | Re-align | Re-align | Re-declare | Re-align | Flip sides | Re-align |

### Motion Adjustment Definitions
- **Lock**: Man defender follows motion player across formation
- **Travel**: Entire defense shifts 2-3 yards toward motion
- **Buzz**: Safety rotates down to motion side
- **Spin**: Full rotation opposite of motion direction
- **Check Call**: Option to flip coverage sides based on new strength
- **Pattern Adjust**: Triggers new pattern match rules
- **MEG Trigger**: Converts to "Man Everywhere he Goes"

## Formation Recognition & Response

### Formation Identification
```typescript
interface FormationAnalysis {
  type: 'balanced' | 'trips' | 'bunch' | 'spread' | 'heavy' | 'empty';
  strength: 'left' | 'right' | 'balanced';
  receiverDistribution: {
    left: number;
    right: number;
    backfield: number;
  };
  personnel: string; // e.g., "11", "12", "10"
}
```

### Formation-Specific Defensive Adjustments
| Formation | Primary Adjustment | Secondary Adjustment | Preferred Coverage |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 2×2 Balanced | Standard alignment | Check motion rules | Cover 2, 4 |
| 3×1 Trips | Rotate to trips | Bump LBs | Cover 3, 6 |
| Bunch (3×1) | Box technique | Switch rules | Cover 1 Jump |
| 4×1 Spread | Nickel/Dime personnel | Widen zones | Cover 1, 3 |
| Empty (5×0) | 5 man coverage | MLB spy option | Cover 0, 1 |
| 12 Personnel | Base defense | SS in box | Tampa 2, Cover 3 |
| 21 Personnel | Goal line adjust | 8 in box | Cover 1, 0 |

## Implementation Guidelines

### Critical Rules for Engine Implementation

1. **Field Positioning**
   - All defenders MUST align on defensive side of LOS (y > 0)
   - Use absolute coordinates for initial alignment
   - Convert to relative positioning post-snap

2. **Zone Coverage Landmarks**
   ```typescript
   const FIELD_LANDMARKS = {
     hashes: [23.58, 29.75],      // Left and right hash marks
     numbers: [9, 44.33],         // Field numbers
     sidelines: [0, 53.33],       // Boundaries
     centerField: 26.67           // Middle of field
   };
   ```

3. **Leverage Rules**
   - **Inside Leverage**: Force receiver outside (Cover 0, slot defenders)
   - **Outside Leverage**: Force receiver inside (Cover 1 with safety help)
   - **Head-up**: Neutral position, react to route (zone coverage)

4. **Pattern Match Transition Points**
   - 5 yards: Short route trigger
   - 10 yards: Intermediate route trigger
   - 12 yards: Vertical route trigger
   - 15 yards: Deep route commitment

5. **Coverage Compatibility Matrix**
   ```typescript
   const COVERAGE_PERSONNEL_COMPATIBILITY = {
     'tampa-2': { required: ['Base', 'Nickel'], incompatible: ['Dime'] },
     'cover-0': { required: [], incompatible: [] },
     'cover-1': { required: [], incompatible: [] },
     'cover-2': { required: [], incompatible: [] },
     'cover-3': { required: [], incompatible: [] },
     'cover-4': { required: [], incompatible: ['Heavy'] },
     'cover-6': { required: [], incompatible: [] }
   };
   ```

### Performance Targets
