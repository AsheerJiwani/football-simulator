## Overview

This document contains comprehensive research on NFL defensive coverage systems for implementation in the football simulator. All information is based on authoritative NFL coaching sources and real-world defensive schemes.

## Coverage Systems

### Cover 0 - All-Out Blitz
**Philosophy**: Pure man-to-man coverage with no deep safety help. Maximum pressure scheme.

**Key Alignments**:
- CBs: Press coverage, 1 yard depth, inside leverage
- Safeties: Man coverage, 5 yards depth
- LBs: Blitz through assigned gaps
- NB: Man coverage on slot, 3 yards depth

**Adjustments**:
- Motion: Man defenders follow assignments
- Trips: Potential safety rotation to cover #3
- Bunch: Switch assignments to avoid picks

### Cover 1 - Single High Safety
**Philosophy**: Man coverage with single high safety providing deep help.

**Key Alignments**:
- CBs: Press coverage, 1 yard depth, inside leverage
- FS: Deep middle third, 12-15 yards
- SS: Man coverage on TE/#2, 5 yards
- LBs: Man coverage on RBs, 4 yards
- NB: Man coverage on slot, 3 yards

**Adjustments**:
- Trips: Safety may provide help on #3
- Motion: Defenders follow man assignments
- Heavy: SS covers additional TE

### Cover 2 - Two Deep Zones
**Philosophy**: Two deep safeties split field with five underneath defenders.

**Key Alignments**:
- CBs: Flat zones, 5-7 yards, outside leverage
- Safeties: Deep halves, 12-15 yards
- LBs: Curl/hook zones, 8-12 yards
- NB: Slot/underneath, 6 yards

**Adjustments**:
- Trips: LB may widen to cover #3
- Spread: Corners expand coverage
- Motion: Minimal zone adjustment

### Cover 3 - Three Deep Zones
**Philosophy**: Three deep defenders each cover a third of field.

**Key Alignments**:
- CBs: Deep thirds, 7-9 yards, inside leverage
- FS: Deep middle third, 12-15 yards
- SS: Curl/flat zone, 5-7 yards
- LBs: Curl zones, 10-12 yards
- NB: Flat zone, 4-6 yards

**Adjustments**:
- Motion: Sky/Buzz rotation calls
- Trips: Safety may robber underneath
- Heavy: SS in run fit

### Cover 4 (Quarters) - Pattern Match
**Philosophy**: Four deep defenders with pattern matching principles.

**Key Alignments**:
- CBs: Deep quarters, 7-8 yards, outside leverage
- Safeties: Inside quarters, 10-12 yards
- LBs: Flat defenders, 6 yards
- NB: Pattern match slot, 5 yards

**Pattern Match Triggers**:
- #1 vertical → Corner carries deep
- #2 vertical → Safety carries deep
- #2 out → Safety drives on route

### Cover 6 - Split Field Coverage
**Philosophy**: Cover 4 to one side, Cover 2 to the other.

**Key Alignments**:
- CB1 (Quarters side): Deep quarter, 7-8 yards
- CB2 (Cover 2 side): Flat, 5-7 yards
- S1: Inside quarter, 10-12 yards
- S2: Deep half, 12-15 yards

**Adjustments**:
- Trips: Quarters to trips side
- Motion: May flip coverage sides

### Tampa 2 - Modified Cover 2
**Philosophy**: Cover 2 with MLB dropping deep to cover middle hole.

**Key Alignments**:
- CBs: Flat zones, 5-7 yards
- Safeties: Deep halves (outside hash only), 12-15 yards
- MLB: Tampa 2 drop, 15-20 yards
- OLBs: Curl zones, 8-12 yards

**Requirements**:
- Requires athletic MLB
- Minimum 3 LBs needed
- Vulnerable in short middle

## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Press depth | 1 yd | Cover 0/1 |
| Off coverage | 7 yd | Cover 3 |
| Deep zone | 12-15 yd | Safety depth |
| Curl/Hook | 8-12 yd | LB drops |
| Flat zone | 5-7 yd | Underneath |
| Tampa 2 MLB | 15-20 yd | Deep drop |
| Tackle radius | 1.5-2.0 yd | Defensive range |

## Motion Adjustments

**Rock & Roll**: Safety exchange based on motion direction
**Buzz**: Rotation with motion (Cover 3)
**Lock**: Man defender follows motion
**Zone Bump**: Zones adjust toward motion
**Spin**: Full rotation opposite of motion

## Formation Recognition

**Trips**: 3+ receivers to one side
**Bunch**: Compressed formation
**Spread**: 4+ WRs
**Heavy**: 2+ TEs or 2+ RBs
**Strength**: TE side or 3-receiver surface

## Implementation Notes

1. All defenders must align on defensive side of LOS (y > 0)
2. Zone defenders use landmarks (hash marks, numbers)
3. Man defenders maintain leverage (inside/outside)
4. Pattern match combines man/zone principles
5. Motion triggers defensive adjustments pre-snap
