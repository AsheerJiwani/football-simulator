# NFL Defensive Movement Mechanics

## Overview
This document contains researched NFL defensive movement mechanics that guide the implementation of realistic defensive player behavior in the football simulator. All values are based on professional coaching sources, combine data, and NFL analysis.

## Man Coverage Techniques

### Press Coverage
- **Alignment**: 1 yard off LOS, 1 yard inside receiver
- **Cushion distance**: 1 yard maximum
- **Technique**: Jam at LOS, maintain inside leverage
- **Usage**: Typically used in Cover 0, Cover 1, or on the strong side of Cover 2

### Off Coverage
- **Cushion distances by route depth**:
  - Short routes (0-10 yards): 5-7 yards cushion
  - Medium routes (10-15 yards): 7-8 yards cushion
  - Deep routes (15+ yards): 5-8 yards cushion with safety help
- **Linebacker man coverage**: 7 yards off slot receivers
- **Cushion break threshold**: 2-3 yards (transition from backpedal to run)

### Trail Technique
- **Position**: Inside hip of receiver, slightly underneath
- **Distance**: 1-2 yards behind receiver in trail position
- **Leverage**: Inside shade to eliminate inside breaking routes
- **Body lean**: Press receiver toward sideline while trailing

## Break Reaction Mechanics

### Reaction Times
- **Average break reaction**: 0.3-0.5 seconds (100ms processing + 200-400ms physical reaction)
- **Hip angular velocity**: 150-180 degrees per second during transitions
- **Transition threshold**: 90-degree hip rotation marks full sprint transition
- **Coaching point**: "Defend the hips" - receiver's hips indicate route direction before eyes

### Movement Speeds
- **Backpedal speed**: 70-80% of forward sprint speed
- **Forward sprint**: Full player speed rating
- **Transition time**: Based on 90-degree hip rotation threshold
- **Acceleration curve**: 0.5 seconds to reach full speed from stop

## Zone Coverage Landmarks

### Cover 2 (Two Deep, Five Under)
- **Safeties (Deep Halves)**:
  - Pre-snap: 15 yards deep
  - Post-snap: 18 yards deep at numbers landmark
  - Coverage width: 26.6 yards per safety (half field)
- **Cornerbacks**:
  - Sink at 45-degree angle
  - 5-7 yards depth (flat/curl-flat zone)
- **Linebackers (Seam-Hook)**:
  - 10-12 yards depth between numbers and hash

### Cover 3 (Three Deep, Four Under)
- **Deep Thirds**:
  - Width: 17.76 yards coverage each
  - Depth: 13+ yards to goal line
- **Cornerbacks**:
  - Protect sidelines from LOS to 15-20 yards
  - Bail technique to deep third
- **Flat coverage**:
  - No closer than 6 yards to sideline (breakdown landmark)
- **Hook/Curl**:
  - 2 yards inside hash
  - 10 yards from LOS

### Cover 4 (Quarters)
- **Deep coverage**: 4-deep, 3-under structure
- **Safety alignment**: Split field coverage from hash marks
- **Pattern matching**: Convert to man after route distribution
- **Deep quarters**: Each defender covers 13.3 yards width

### Tampa 2 (Modified Cover 2)
- **Middle linebacker**:
  - Carry seam route down middle
  - Open hips to strength
  - Drop to 18-22 yards (deep hole)
- **Outside linebackers**:
  - LOS to 10 yards coverage zone
- **Safety depth**:
  - Standard Cover 2 alignment (15→18 yards)
- **Red zone adjustment**:
  - Converts to "Red 2" at plus-15 yard line

### Cover 6 (Quarter-Quarter-Half)
- **Strong side**: Cover 4 principles
- **Weak side**: Cover 2 principles
- **Robber safety**: Drop to middle hook, act as trap coverage
- **Pattern match triggers**: Based on #2 receiver route

## Pattern Matching Rules

### Cover 4 MEG (Man Everywhere he Goes)
- **Trigger**: Any vertical or breaking route
- **Response**: Convert to sticky man coverage
- **Technique**: Follow receiver everywhere on field

### Cover 4 MOD (Man Only Deep)
- **Vertical routes**: Convert to man coverage
- **Horizontal routes**: Stay in zone, pass off to helper
- **Depth threshold**: 8+ yards triggers man conversion

### Quarters Adjustments
- **#1 Vertical**: Corner carries deep
- **#2 Vertical**: Safety takes #2, corner takes #1
- **#2 In/Out**: Safety drives on route, corner stays deep
- **Smash concept**: Corner sits on corner route, safety takes deep

## Movement Transitions

### Backpedal to Sprint
- **Cushion break point**: 2.5 yards average
- **Hip flip time**: 0.2-0.3 seconds
- **Speed during transition**: 50% of max for 0.2 seconds

### Zone to Man Conversion
- **Pattern recognition time**: 1.0-1.5 seconds after snap
- **Conversion trigger**: Based on route distribution
- **Communication requirement**: "Push" or "Lock" calls

### Rally Angles
- **Deep to underneath**: 45-degree angle
- **Lateral pursuit**: Match receiver speed + 10%
- **Closing speed**: Full sprint when within 5 yards

## Implementation Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Usage |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------|
| Press cushion | 1 yd | 1 yd | Press man technique |
| Off cushion | 7 yd | 5-8 yd | Off man technique |
| Trail distance | 1.5 yd | 1-3 yd | Man coverage trailing |
| Break reaction delay | 0.4s | 0.3-0.5s | Route break response |
| Backpedal speed | 75% | 70-80% | % of forward speed |
| Zone drop speed | 85% | 80-90% | Controlled zone drops |
| Hip flip time | 0.25s | 0.2-0.3s | Transition duration |
| Pattern match trigger | 1.25s | 1.0-1.5s | After snap |
| Rally angle | 45° | 30-60° | Pursuit angles |
| Cushion break | 2.5 yd | 2-3 yd | Backpedal transition |

## Testing Scenarios

### Man Coverage Tests
1. **Press vs Slant**: CB jams at 1 yard, maintains inside leverage
2. **Off vs Go**: CB at 7 yards, turns and runs at cushion break
3. **Trail vs Out**: CB trails 1.5 yards behind, drives on break

### Zone Coverage Tests
1. **Cover 2 vs Four Verts**: Safeties split deep, LBs wall #2
2. **Cover 3 vs Flood**: Flat defender takes #1, hook takes #2
3. **Tampa 2 vs Post**: MLB carries post to deep hole

### Pattern Match Tests
1. **Cover 4 MEG vs Smash**: Corner matches corner route
2. **Cover 6 vs Trips**: Strong side matches, weak plays Cover 2
3. **Quarters vs Mesh**: Underneath defenders pass off crossers
