# NFL Zone Coverage Bubbles - Research & Implementation Guide

**Task & Scope:** Comprehensive NFL zone coverage responsibilities and visual representation guidelines
**Version:** 2025-09-14-v1
**Assumptions & Constraints:** 7 defenders in coverage, vertical field orientation (120 yards), no OL/DL simulation

## Field Model Mapping

### Field Coordinates
- **Origin:** Line of scrimmage at (0, 0)
- **Y-axis:** +y = defense end zone direction (100 yards)
- **X-axis:** Sideline to sideline (53.33 yards total width)
- **Field dimensions:** 120 yards total (100 + 2Ã—10 end zones)

### Key Field Landmarks
- **Hash marks:** 18.33 yards from each sideline (6 yards apart)
- **Numbers:** ~9 yards from each sideline
- **Middle of field:** 26.67 yards from each sideline
- **Hash-to-hash width:** 6 yards
- **Sideline landmarks:**
  - Deep coverage: minimum 9 yards from sideline
  - Flat coverage: minimum 6 yards from sideline

### Coverage Depth Zones
- **Underneath zones:** 0-13 yards from LOS
- **Deep zones:** 13+ yards from LOS to goal line
- **Critical depth markers:** 8, 10, 12, 15 yards

## Visual Representation Guidelines

### Color Coding Standards
- **Deep zones:** Dark blue (#1e3a8a) with 40% opacity
- **Underneath zones:** Light blue (#3b82f6) with 30% opacity
- **Flat zones:** Green (#22c55e) with 35% opacity
- **Hook zones:** Yellow (#eab308) with 30% opacity
- **Vulnerability areas:** Red (#ef4444) with 25% opacity
- **Pattern match zones:** Purple (#8b5cf6) with 30% opacity

### Shape Guidelines
- **Rectangle zones:** Standard zone coverage areas
- **Ellipse zones:** Pattern matching or combination coverage
- **Polygon zones:** Complex coverage with multiple landmarks
- **Gradient zones:** Zones with shared responsibilities

### Zone Bubble Dimensions (Yards)

#### Deep Zone Standards
```json
{
  "cover_2_halves": { "width": 26.67, "depth": "12_to_endzone" },
  "cover_3_thirds": { "width": 17.78, "depth": "12_to_endzone" },
  "cover_4_quarters": { "width": 13.33, "depth": "12_to_endzone" },
  "tampa_2_hole": { "width": 6, "depth": "15_to_endzone", "shape": "ellipse" }
}
```

#### Underneath Zone Standards
```json
{
  "flat_zones": {
    "width": 15,
    "depth": 8,
    "landmarks": "hash_to_numbers",
    "min_sideline_distance": 6
  },
  "curl_zones": {
    "width": 12,
    "depth": 4,
    "landmarks": "10_to_12_yard_depth",
    "center_point": "numbers"
  },
  "hook_zones": {
    "width": 6,
    "depth": 4,
    "landmarks": "8_to_12_yard_depth",
    "center_point": "between_hashes"
  }
}
```

### Display Properties
- **Zone borders:** 2px solid with coverage-specific colors
- **Zone fills:** Semi-transparent overlays (25-40% opacity)
- **Zone labels:** 12px bold font, contrasting colors
- **Animation:** Smooth transitions (300ms) when coverage changes
- **Responsive scaling:** Zones scale with field canvas dimensions

## Formation & Hash Adjustments

### Hash Position Effects
- **Left hash:** Boundary coverage tightened, field coverage expanded
- **Right hash:** Field coverage tightened, boundary coverage expanded
- **Middle field:** Symmetrical coverage responsibilities

### Personnel Package Adjustments
- **11 Personnel (3WR, 1TE, 1RB):** Standard zone dimensions
- **10 Personnel (4WR, 0TE, 1RB):** Wider flat zones, compressed hooks
- **12 Personnel (2WR, 2TE, 1RB):** Tighter zones, more run support
- **21 Personnel (2WR, 1TE, 2RB):** Condensed zones, aggressive support

### Motion Adjustments
- **Across formation:** Rotate zones with motion direction
- **Vertical motion:** Adjust zone depths and widths
- **Bunch formations:** Create combination coverage zones

### Engine-Ready Zone Rules
```typescript
// Zone bubble creation based on coverage type
function createZoneBubbles(coverage: CoverageType, formation: Formation): ZoneBubble[] {
  const zones: ZoneBubble[] = [];

  switch(coverage) {
    case 'Cover_2':
      zones.push({
        id: 'deep_left_half',
        type: 'rectangle',
        x: 0, y: 12, width: 26.67, height: 88,
        color: '#1e3a8a', opacity: 0.4
      });
      zones.push({
        id: 'deep_right_half',
        type: 'rectangle',
        x: 26.67, y: 12, width: 26.67, height: 88,
        color: '#1e3a8a', opacity: 0.4
      });
      // Add underneath zones...
      break;

    case 'Cover_3':
      // Three deep thirds
      for(let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        zones.push({
          id: `deep_third_${i}`,
          type: 'rectangle',
          x: i * 17.78, y: 12, width: 17.78, height: 88,
          color: '#1e3a8a', opacity: 0.4
        });
      }
      break;
  }

  return adjustZonesForHash(zones, formation.hashPosition);
}
```

## Test Cases & Validation

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Cover 2 vs 11 Personnel, middle hash:** Two deep halves, five underneath zones visible
2. **Cover 3 Sky rotation vs trips:** Safety rotates down, corner bails to deep third
3. **Tampa 2 vs 2Ã—2 formation:** MLB hole zone appears between safeties
4. **Cover 4 vs motion across:** Pattern matching zones adjust with route concepts
5. **Cover 6 split field:** Quarters to field side, halves to boundary side

### Visual Validation Points
- Zone boundaries align with field landmarks (hashes, numbers)
- Coverage gaps and overlaps accurately represented
- Zone colors and opacity provide clear differentiation
- Animations smooth during coverage transitions
- Responsive scaling maintains proportions

## Implementation Notes

- Zone bubbles should be toggleable via "Show Defense" control
- Opacity and colors should be configurable for accessibility
- Zone dimensions must scale with field canvas size
- Coverage transitions should animate smoothly (300ms duration)
- Vulnerability areas (like Tampa 2 hole) can be highlighted in Challenge mode for educational purposes

This research provides the foundational knowledge needed to implement realistic, visually compelling zone coverage bubbles that accurately represent NFL defensive responsibilities and help users understand defensive concepts.
